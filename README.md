# RollUp

Clear communication in one of the most important aspects of any event. We receive a combination of emails, phone calls and IMs for every event we attend. Information keeps pouring into our minds from all over the place at the same time and it becomes difficult to be able to keep up with the flow.

But imagine if you simply see a summary of what each communication is about, and then interact only with the ones that are relevant to you. That is exactly what we have achieved with RollUp. 

This engine was presented as a SlackBot at YHacks '18.
The text summarization engine behind the bot,Â however can be adapted to emails, transcribed meetings and several other modes of communication.
